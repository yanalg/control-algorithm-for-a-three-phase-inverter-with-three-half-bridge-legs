 DESIGN OF POWER  ELECTRONICS CIRCUITS - 046045 
Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a control algorithm for a three-phase inverter with three half-bridge legs. The focus is on achieving robust grid synchronization using two distinct methods:

1. Decoupled Double Synchronous Reference Frame Phase-Locked Loop (DDSRF-PLL)

2. Double Second-Order Generalized Integrator Frequency-Locked Loop (DSOGI-FLL)

The behavior of these synchronization methods will be compared under various grid fault conditions, with the grid modeled as voltage sources. The inverter control algorithm and synchronization methods are tested across a range of grid inductance values (50 Î¼H to 3 mH) and X/R ratios (2 to 10).
Grid Fault Testing:

Test synchronization methods under the following grid fault scenarios:

(a) Single phase to ground.

(b) Two-phase short.

(c) Two-phase short to ground.
